          <div class="faq-detail">
            <p>While general information is valuable, certain medical tests offer deeper insights. <br>
              Blood tests for cholesterol levels, glucose tolerance tests, blood pressure measurements, electrocardiograms (ECG),
               stress tests, and imaging studies like echocardiograms or CT scans can provide critical data for a more accurate heart health prediction.</p>
